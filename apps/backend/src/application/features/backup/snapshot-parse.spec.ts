/**
 * Reading a snapshot back in.
 *
 * `BackupController` caps the upload at 64 MB as bytes arrive, which bounds
 * what is *read* and says nothing about what is *allocated*. `parse()` called
 * `gunzipSync` with no output limit, and gzip reaches roughly 1000:1 on
 * repetitive input — so an upload inside the limit could ask for tens of
 * gigabytes of heap in one synchronous call, inside a 1 GB function. The cap
 * that matters is on the decompressed size.
 *
 * `parse` is private, so these go through `restore`, which calls it before it
 * touches the database. Every case here fails during parsing, so the tenant
 * client is never reached and a stub for it is enough.
