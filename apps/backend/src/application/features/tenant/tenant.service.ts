   * cache. A newly onboarded tenant is never stale — a not-found slug is
   * never cached, so the first request after provisioning is always a live
   * lookup. A tenant deactivated mid-window stays servable for up to
   * `TENANT_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`, which is the accepted trade for taking this
   * off the hot path; that operation is rare and deliberate, not something
   * that needs to take effect within milliseconds.
