 * disclosure than any read route on this system, and restore replaces that
 * register outright. An AUDITOR reads the books; neither of these is reading.
 *

 * has no multipart parser, and adding one for a single route would be a
 * dependency plus an upload surface on every other route. Sending it as
 * `application/gzip` also means no body parser touches it — see `readBody`.
