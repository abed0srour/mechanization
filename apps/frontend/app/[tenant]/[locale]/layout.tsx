          declared on, and `--primary` is declared on `:root` — a
          `--brand-primary` sitting on <body> would simply never be seen by the
          `var()` that reads it. And keeping it off the inline style attribute
          leaves that attribute to `next-themes`, which writes `color-scheme`
          there.

          Precedence falls out of this: an explicit accent (`[data-accent]`,
          also on the root) overrides `--primary` outright, so a staff member's
          choice beats the municipality's default rather than being silently
          ignored.
