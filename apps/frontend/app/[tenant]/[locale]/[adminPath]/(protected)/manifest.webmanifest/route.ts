/**
 * The web app manifest — per municipality, and per admin path.
 *
 * Not `app/manifest.ts` at the root, which is Next's convention and would be
 * one file for the whole portal. A manifest's `start_url` is where the icon on
 * the home screen leads, and this portal has no single such place: every staff
 * route is `/{tenant}/{locale}/{adminPath}/…`, the tenant differs per
 * municipality, and `adminPath` is deliberately obscure per tenant. A root
 * manifest could only point at `/`, which rewrites to a 404.
 *
 * It also means the icon on a field officer's phone is *their* municipality's,
 * and that installing the portal for two municipalities gives two apps rather
 * than one that opens the wrong register.
 *
 * Why install at all: a standalone home-screen app is far less likely to be
 * discarded by the browser than a tab, and when it is killed it relaunches
 * into the shell the service worker holds. That is the difference between
 * "survives a dropped connection" and "works for an afternoon in a settlement".
