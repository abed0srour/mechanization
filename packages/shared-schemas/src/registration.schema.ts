 * What is left of the old submission schema: the رقم العقار lookup.
 *
 * Everything else in this file described the citizen-facing طلب and the
 * municipality's adjudication of it — `submitRegistrationSchema` (the six-step
 * wizard payload, with its document slots and its الإقرار), `changeStatusSchema`
 * (the reviewer's transition), and `REJECTABLE_FIELDS` (the field-by-field
 * rejection vocabulary the reviewer picked from and the applicant's correction
 * form resolved back to captions).
 *
 * None of it has a subject any more. Records are entered by staff from
 * documents handed across a counter, so there is no submission to validate at
 * the door, no decision to record against it, and no citizen waiting to be
 * told which field to fix. The property-number check survives because it is
 * about the *cadastre*, not about a طلب: it answers "is this a real parcel in
 * this municipality", which the staff entry form asks on every keystroke.
